                    </h3>
                    <p>Morning focuses on technical drills: first touch, passing accuracy, and ball control. Evenings
                        are for tactical play:
                        small-sided games and position-specific scenarios. All sessions are filmed for review. Players
                        receive weekly progress
                        reports from their assigned coach.</p>

                    <p>Strikers work on finishing and movement. Defenders train 1v1 duels and aerial dominance.
                        Midfielders develop passing
                        range and transition play. Goalkeepers get specialized shot-stopping and distribution drills.
                        Coaches are assigned by
                        position.</p>

                        heavier ball develops
                        superior technique. Sessions are mandatory and supervised by futsal-certified coaches.</p>
